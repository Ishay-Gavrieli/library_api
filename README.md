A library data management system that is responsible for creating books, updating books, borrowing and returning them to the member.
the actions: creating library members, updating them, deactivating and activating them, and it can return data about the users and the books. 


## 2.
docker: docker run --name  mysql-library_db -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -e MYSQL_DATABASE=library_db -p 3309:3306 -d mysql:latest

docker:docker exec -it mysql-library_db mysql -u root -p

# books table:
id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT
title varchar(50) NOT NULL 
author varchar(50) NOT NULL
genre ENUM("Fiction","Non-Fiction","Science","History","Other") NOT NULL
is_available BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE
borrowed_by_member_id INT DEFAULT NULL 


# members table:
id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT
name varchar(50) NOT NULL 
email UNIQUE NOT NULL 
email varchar(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL, 
is_active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
total_borrows INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
 
    
    



## 5.
# System rules:
1. When creating a book, the user sends genre/author/title and the function should update
is_available=True, borrowed_by=NULL

2. When updating and creating a book, the genre must have the value we set in the enum, any other value will return a 404 error

3. When creating a friend, the user sends mail/name and the function must add total_borrows=0 is_active=True

4. The email must be unique and if it already exists, it returns a 422 error

5. When borrowing a book if the friend does not exist (False=active_is) the book cannot be borrowed 

6. It is not possible to borrow a book that is already borrowed if the parameter is_available=false

7. A friend cannot have more than three books

8. A book can only be returned if I borrowed it
